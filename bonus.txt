- The simulation accumulates errors and does not stop after first error received
- The simulation validates the correctness of the error code returned by the algorithm for every stage
- The simulation prints the errors in the <algo Name>_<travel_Name>.errors file all errors that it found (all illegal algo operations)

To show the simulation ability we provided:
IncorrectAlgorithm - that consist of multiple errors:
1) Can unload containers in wrong destination port
2) Returns incorrect error code from get instructionForCargo
3) Loads the second container (and not the first!) if there are more than one container with the same id in load list
4) Loads containers with destination that does not appear in ship route, or that its ports destination is the current port

The simulation validates all types of errors, and not only these specific errors that IncorrectAlgorithm performs
We provided two different travels to demonstrate the simulators abilities:

Travel1: The algorithm unloads container in port BBBBB when it is supposed to be unloaded in CCCCC

Travel2:
- In first port there are two containers with the same ID waiting with different destinations, the first with destination BBBBB
and the second with destination CCCCC. The algorithm loads the second container, and unloads it correctly at CCCCC, and the simulation
reports that the second of multiple ID containers was loaded and not the first.

- The algorithm loads container with a destination that is the same as the current port, in first visit at AAAAA
- The algorithm does not return the correct error code for these situations (2^10, 2^13)

======================================================================================================================================
In addition our algorithms protect themselves from an incorrect simulator.
Algorithms make sure that all three steps needed to init the algorithm (readShipPlan, readShipRoute, setWeightBalanceCalculator) finish successfully.
If a simulator chooses to run getInstructionForCargo although the algorithm reports error code that prevent the run of the travel, the algorithm only creates empty file crane_instructions.

How to compile IncorrectAlgorithm:
- In the zip of our project, we created a directory bonus-algorithm with another makefile. The make will create an extra IncorrectAlgorithm.so file
- This algorithm can be run with any travel files, to see our examples please run our provided Travels directory.
